# Just labs that im making during subject with reports
My labs from NSTU second course subject "Techonolgies and methods of programming"
### What was used?
Visual Studio 2019 Community (C++ 17)
### How to run it?
You can use cmake/g++ compilers for it, but the easiest way will be using Visual Studio 2022 (MSVC 143, CMake C++ for Windows). Open a folder with lab and then open file with extension ```.sln```

To compile it on Linux/Mac, in terminal type
```
g++ -o prog_1 program_1.cpp
```
If you dont have g++ on your PC, on Linux you can do this:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt -y install build-essential
```
On Windows you must use MinGW instalator

I will add more information later, when I will be (maybe) also use .dll/.lib libraries
